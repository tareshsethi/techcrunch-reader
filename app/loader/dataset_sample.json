            "content": "In this week\u2019s edition of The Interchange, we touch on M&As in the fintech space as AngelList nabbed a startup and Uplift got bought for less than it raised in venture funding. We get into those deals, and much more. Want to receive this in your inbox every Sunday? Sign up here.\nLast week, Shopify announced a new offering \u2014 Shopify Credit, a business credit card designed exclusively for its merchants. The new product marked Shopify\u2019s first pay-in-full business credit card, said Shopify president Harley Finkelstein. It is powered by Stripe and issued by Celtic Bank, \u201cand accepted everywhere Visa is,\u201d he added. My editor and I were intrigued by the fact that Shopify insisted it would charge no fees \u2014 no late fees, no foreign transaction fees, and no interest. But upon further digging into the fine print, as fellow fintech enthusiast Sar Haribhakti tweeted about, it turns out that Shopify is also describing the new offering as a \u201cpay in full credit card.\u201d So, merchants have 25 days after the close of their monthly billing cycle to pay their balance. And if they don\u2019t? Well, according to Shopify\u2019s website, the card will be locked and the merchant won\u2019t be able to make any new purchases until the balance has been repaid. That explains how/why the company is not charging any interest! Unfortunately, I was traveling early last week and didn\u2019t get to actually speak to Harley \u2014 our interview was over email, and somehow this little tidbit of information got left out. It certainly was not something that Shopify publicized. It feels like retail/commerce companies deciding to go into the credit card space should proceed with some caution, though, if Apple\u2019s experience is any indication. The Information did a deep dive last week on how \u201cthe tech giant and the Wall Street titan went from \u2018the most successful credit card launch ever\u2019 to Goldman trying to exit the partnership.\u201d\nI also gave us an update on fintech startup Jeeves, which did something that us reporters wish more (actually, all) private companies would do \u2014 share financials. We\u2019ve been covering the goings-on at Jeeves since the startup first emerged from stealth in July of 2021, announcing $131 million in debt and equity financing from investors such as Andreessen Horowitz (a16z). It then announced a $57 million Series B exactly three months later. Jeeves is among the many players in the corporate card space \u2014 but CEO and founder Dileep Thazhmon believes it\u2019s got an advantage over competitors in that it can serve clients in Latin America (its biggest market) and other regions by offering cards that can be paid in local currencies. That\u2019s a big deal, he says, because businesses can save money on foreign transaction fees, for example. He told us: \u201cThis is a really big differentiator because it means we\u2019re the only expense management company that can issue local cards in Latin America, North America and Europe. It takes time to build rails in other countries. If you look at U.S.-based expense management platforms, they cannot onboard a company headquartered in Mexico. If you look at Mexican expense management providers, they cannot onboard a company [that] is headquartered in the U.S. Jeeves can do both.\u201d Read about how Jeeves entered 2023 with annualized revenue of $40 million, its recent expansion beyond corporate cards into prepaid cards and cross-border payments, and what its plans for the future are here.\nI also got the exclusive on some big news out of AngelList \u2014 its purchase of fintech startup Nova and formal expansion into the private equity space. I talked both with AngelList CEO Avlok Kohli and Nova founder Pradyuman Vig about how the deal came about and what the expansion means for the organization. On Friday\u2019s episode of the Equity podcast, Alex Wilhelm, Kirsten Korosec and I dug into what some might consider an unexpected move for AngelList \u2014 which has historically served early-stage investors. Hint: We thought it might have a little something to do with its 2022 raise that was co-led by a global investor that rhymes with Kiger. Private equity talk aside, it\u2019s always cool to see a young founder with not just one exit under their belt, but two \u2014 by the age of 26. \u2014 Mary Ann\nImage Credits: Founder Dileep Thazhmon / Jeeves\nImage Credits: Founder Dileep Thazhmon / Jeeves\nWhat do caregiving and divorce have in common? Financial stress for employees. This week, Christine reported on Helpful raising $7.5 million. The new app brings together insurance benefits, medical records and caregiving resources into one dashboard.\nAs reported by Manish Singh: \u201cThe world\u2019s largest asset manager is re-entering India \u2014 and it\u2019s doing so in a partnership with Asia\u2019s richest man. Jio Financial Services and BlackRock have struck a deal to form a joint venture, called Jio BlackRock, aimed at serving India\u2019s growing investor base. BlackRock and Reliance\u2019s finance unit are targeting an initial investment of $150 million each into the new 50/50 venture, which will seek to offer tech-enabled access to \u2018affordable, innovative\u2019 investment solutions for millions of investors in India, they said.\u201d More here.\nDan Macklin, co-founder of SoFi, has joined Summer as president to help more students and families navigate and reduce student loans. TechCrunch reported on his original departure from SoFi here.\nWe spotted a tweet (or whatever it\u2019s called now) by Forbes\u2019 Alex Konrad this week about his interview with Victor Lazarte (the former CEO of Brazilian games startup Wildlife Studios), who is Benchmark\u2019s newest equal partner. Lazarte told Forbes that he will invest broadly but has an interest in startups in games, consumer and fintech. TechCrunch\u2019s Connie Loizos caught up with Benchmark\u2019s Miles Grimshaw in June to discuss AI investment. More here.\nAlso, feds raised rates, and now some fintechs are doing so, too. Wealthfront announced on X that the rate on its \u201cCash Account\u201d is increasing to 4.80% APY (annual percentage yield), up from 4.55% through its partner banks. If you refer a friend, you get 5.30% APY. Perhaps an interesting note is the up to $5 million FDIC insurance (and $10 million for joint accounts) being offered. Not to be outdone is Robinhood, which also announced via X that it was offering 4.9% APY on accounts that were FDIC-insured up to $2 million through program banks.\nSix ways FedNow may affect businesses\u2019 cash flow\u00a0 \nVesttoo investigation reveals $4B fraud involving fake letters of credit\nJohn Collison\u2019s land grab: A Stripe co-founder grows in power\nMastercard\u2019s cease-and-desist letters halt cannabis debit card transactions\nClearwater Analytics to launch new generative artificial intelligence solution for investment management\nAmerican Express introduces commercial partner program\nSeen on TechCrunch\nUpgrade acquires travel-focused BNPL startup Uplift for a song (This is particularly notable considering that Uplift got acquired for far less than it raised over its lifetime.)\nGlossGenius raises $28M to expand its bookings and payments platform for beauty businesses\nBloom Money raises \u00a31M to digitize finance for ethnic communities\na16z-backed Eco unveils Beam, a P2P crypto transfer service aiming to be a \u2018global Venmo\u2019\nBunq, the Dutch neobank, has raised $111M at a flat $1.8B valuation to break into the US\u00a0\nSeen elsewhere\nInspectify, which sells software for property inspection services, lands $5.7M\u00a0\nDigital MGA Foxquilt secures $12M funding\nHouston workforce training startup acquired by California company\nMercury Financial secures $200M for its credit card business expansion\nDeposit \u2018marketplace\u2019 launches with backing from BMO\nSettle books $145M credit facility from Silicon Valley Bank\u00a0\nJoin us at TechCrunch Disrupt 2023 in San Francisco this September as we explore the impact of fintech on our world today.

This week, I wrote about Supply Change Capital, which closed on $40 million in capital commitments for its first fund, targeting investments in the global food industry.\nThe female and Latina-owned firm is spearheaded by co-founders and managing partners Noramay Cadena and Shayna Harris, who met 14 years ago in business school.\nThe firm has already made 15 investments, including in allergen-free snack food company Partake Foods, ingredients startup Michroma and alternative seafood maker Aqua Cultured Foods.\nSupply Change joins firms like Joyful Ventures, which debuted in June with $23 million, focused on investment in sustainable protein startups. Joyful was co-founded by Jennifer Stojkovic, Milo Runkle and Blaine Vess and has made two investments from the fund, including New School Foods and Orbillion Bio.\nGlobal investment in food tech and agtech startups were 44% lower than in 2021, totaling $29.6 billion last year. Granted, 2021 had record-breaking investments into this space, but with all this dry powder on the sidelines, it looks promising for the next year.\nBrevel sprouts $18.5M to develop microalgae-based alternative proteins\nMicroalgae is everywhere, it seems. This week, Brevel announced a large seed round that will go toward developing microalgae into an alternative protein powder that can be used in foods.\nCultivated beef, it\u2019s what\u2019s for dinner in Europe: Israel\u2019s Aleph Farms gears up to sell first cultivated beef cuts in Europe.\nNew to the aisles of Whole Foods Markets: Actual Veggies expands at the grocery chain amid over 300% growth in the past year. Meati Foods makes its national launch in 46 states (here\u2019s more about them). And Konscious Foods debuts its frozen, plant-based sushi there.\nEgg-citing growth: Yo! Egg makes its nationwide launch via a partnership with Veggie Grill. Read our coverage of the company, especially as it relates to the recent hike in traditional egg prices.\nSmooth to the touch: MycoWorks unveils plastic-free leather alternative for luxury fashion brands.

            "content": "Building a startup is hard enough but growing one in a category marred with Theranos-sized stigma is a new level of challenge. Vital Bio seems up for the test.\nThe Toronto-based startup is building a machine, VitalOne, that can perform more than 50 blood tests \u2014 covering nearly all of those considered routine \u2014 and get patient results back in 20 minutes, not multiple days. Co-founder and CEO Vasu Nadella said that he got interested in the space because he and his co-founders have watched family members deal with chronic illness and know that being able to get quick diagnostic results is crucial for treatment.\nPlus, Nadella wanted to know why companies couldn\u2019t seem to get the solution to this problem right. While Theranos failed for a variety of reasons, the other companies trying to build these quicker blood diagnostic tools had yet to ship products. He thought maybe he could crack the code.\nThe startup launched in 2019 and built quietly until it debuted its device at the American Association of Clinical Chemistry\u2019s annual meeting \u2014 the industry\u2019s \u201cSuper Bowl\u201d \u2014 last Monday. Vital Bio also announced that it had raised $48 million in venture funding from Labcorp, Inovia Capital, Lachy Groom and Sam Altman, among others.\nNadella said the company has focused on making sure that its device produces accurate results and that when it does drift, they know how to prevent it from impacting the final diagnosis. He said the company waited to start talking about what it was up to until it felt it had enough to back up its claims. "

Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Friday.\nNot to get all GrumpyManYellsAtCloud.gif, but I\u2019m getting pretty tired of the myth of the dropped-out-of-college founders. Investors \u2014 and the broader ecosystem \u2014 have known for a long time that while there are some high-profile outliers, it\u2019s much easier to build a startup if you have a fat Rolodex, some experience, and perhaps a few failures under your belt. I know Hollywood doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s nearly as good of a story, but\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0perhaps it\u2019d be good to balance things out a little on that front.\nApropos meddling: Those robots have been hard at work generating smut, and Kyle reports that as AI porn generators get better, the stakes get higher. Perhaps as a result of that story (and the internet reaching fever pitch over AI porn), an interview we did with the Unstable Diffusion team last year is hella trending again on TechCrunch.\nApropos even more meddling: It seems that even very experienced founders get things pretty wrong from time to time, too \u2014 Elmo isn\u2019t done running Twitter into the ground, it seems. This week, the burning wreckage of a social media site officially changed its logo to X. That has had some, er, curious side effects, including a lot of rebranding and renaming. Uniting the themes of smut and social media, Twitter Videos has so far resisted to rename itself, and one social media account (NSFW) seems to hint at why.\nImage Credits: nadia_bormotova / Getty Images\nImage Credits: nadia_bormotova / Getty Images\nI know, it seems like there\u2019s always an AI section in Startups Weekly at the moment. Don\u2019t blame me \u2014 blame the flamin\u2019 hot news coming out of that vertical at the moment.\nOn TC+, Nick Zamanov penned an article about how his company tried using OpenAI to generate marketing strategies \u2014 and was delighted to discover that it worked.\nMeanwhile, OpenAI just released a neat feature that introduces customized instructions for ChatGPT. Instead of having to type \u201cwrite me a three-section newsletter in the style of TechCrunch\u2019s Startups Weekly, and smatter in some really dumb jokes,\u201d you can configure that as the default behavior. Writing newsletters is going to be so quick in the future, I swear. (Just kidding: I\u2019ve tried. ChatGPT\u2019s attempts at writing this thing were as dull as dishwater. My job is safe for another week or two.)\nThe bots are coming to the Androids: ChatGPT comes to Android, and soon became available in the U.S., India, Bangladesh and Brazil. OpenAI plans to release the app in more countries very soon.\nI\u2019m sure that wasn\u2019t a stressful job: After just 18 months in the job, OpenAI\u2019s head of trust and safety Dave Willner steps down. The company\u2019s CTO Mira Murati will manage the team on an interim basis while they find a replacement.\nLet\u2019s translate this from corporate-ese into bot-speak: A startup that\u2019s building tools to help prepare enterprise data to get gobbled up into large language models, Unstructured raises $25 million.\nImage Credits: Images by Christina Kilgour / Getty Images\nImage Credits: Images by Christina Kilgour / Getty Images\nThis week, I\u2019ve been doing a lot of thinking about the job of a founder. I already mentioned the TechCrunch+ piece I wrote about startups not just being a young person\u2019s game, and I spoke with a founder who decided to replace himself as the CEO of his own company. Earlier this week, I also spoke with DeeDee Deman, who has spent the past 50 years headhunting CEOs, to get some tips on how you can think about finding a new CEO for your startup.\nWhile on the topic of replacements \u2014 Sequoia Capital\u2019s Michael Moritz moves on, almost 40 years after he joined the influential venture fund. He\u2019s going to continue board work with a handful of companies but is planning to hand over most of the workload to other Sequoia partners.\nCompanies are still going public. Just not startups: It\u2019s been a drought in the tech startup IPO space, but on TC+, Alex crunched the numbers and realized that there\u2019s still a lot of activity \u2014 and it\u2019s making startups look silly as hell.\nOptimizing for impact: More and more companies are thinking about climate \u2014 and impact investors are flocking to the segment. That scares me a bit,\u00a0but Agnes Svensson, the chief impact officer at Norrsken VC, shares five key questions climate tech founders should ask impact investors.\nOne of the most amazing social experiments: Reddits r/place is an incredible experiment, where a logged-in user can place a single pixel on a canvas every 5 minutes. It\u2019s one of my favorite things about the internet, because it requires something utterly rare: coordination and teamwork. Of course, redditors used this year\u2019s evolution of the game to shout loudly about the API changes that have sparked a revolt on the social media site.\n\u00a0\nImage Credits: Bryce Durbin / TechCrunch\nImage Credits: Bryce Durbin / TechCrunch\nAutonomous trucking company Aurora sells $820 million worth of stock in order to continue its drive toward launching an autonomous trucking business in 2024. Around the same time, Waymo put the brakes on its self-driving trucks program.\nMeanwhile, peeking at Tesla\u2019s business fundamentals, Rebecca reminds us that the company is an automaker, not a tech company \u2014 and that its margins look a lot more like Ford than, say, Salesforce.\nTime for another U-turn: We\u2019ve been flip-flopping on this one for a while, but it seems like GM has changed its mind once again, saying it isn\u2019t going to kill off the Chevy Bolt EV after all. Personally, I think that\u2019s great. We need smaller, more affordable EVs.\nTapping the zap: Seven of the largest automakers today announced a joint venture to create a massive EV charging network across North America.\nTopping up at home: In smaller charging news, Voltpost raised a $3.6 million seed round to bring EV charging to the curbside.\nIn addition to some of the big hitters sprinkled throughout above, here are some of our mustn\u2019t-miss stories for the week:\nMaybe it\u2019s just taking a nap?: I argued that VR as a category is dead\u00a0and failed to find a killer app. AR is picking up the mantle, but we\u2019ll see if it can do better.\nI dunno, maybe hide better?: Zack reports that North Korean hackers targeting JumpCloud may have forgotten to mask their IP addresses properly, researchers say.\nBuy it, then kill it: Aria reports that SpaceX has made only one acquisition to date (that we are aware of), but Swarm Technologies is halting new device sales. It seems that the acquisition may have been an aqui-hire, as Swarm\u2019s founders are finding senior positions across SpaceX.\nStalking for cash: Zack had a couple of popular articles this week. He reported that Spyhide stalkerware is spying on tens of thousands of phones, and he dug into how TheTruthSpy stalkerware made its millions.\nEnough, already: It\u2019s getting more and more frustrating to report on this, but startups with all-women founding teams raised just $1.4 billion in H1, Dominic-Madori reports. That\u2019s a paltry 1.6% of all venture funding invested. Mixed-gender teams picked up 28%.\nGet your TechCrunch fix IRL.

            "content": "Unito is a platform that takes a different approach to managing SaaS apps. Today we\u2019ll take a look at how the company\u2019s pitch deck helped it raise $20 million in Series B funding last year.\nWe\u2019re looking for more unique pitch decks to tear down, so if you want to submit your own, here\u2019s how you can do that.\u00a0\nUnito shared its 12-slide deck, which is lightly redacted: It removed some logos for the companies it works with and left out its target companies, revenue targets and its growth chart. Still, even with these details omitted, we get a great picture of the company\u2019s narrative structure.\nHere\u2019s an overview of the slides:\nThe slide deck is missing a lot of information that I\u2019d have liked to see, but the information that\u2019s there is extraordinarily clean and simple, without going too deep into the weeds. The slides\u2019 design is simple, clean and easy to read. If you only take away one thing from this teardown, let it be: Simplify your slides!\nAt early-stage companies, \u201cfounder/market fit\u201d is the name of the game. By the time you grow to a Series B, however, you\u2019re on your path toward growth, and the focus of the senior team shifts toward building, growing and retaining your team. Unito\u2019s team slide tells that story beautifully:\n[Slide 11] A great team slide. Image Credits: UnitoA combination of team building, startup experience and domain expertise lays the foundation for a great story around the senior team. The Glassdoor ratings and the company\u2019s \u201cbetter workplace toolkit\u201d shows that it practices what it preaches, and that \u2014 combined with the company\u2019s growth trajectory \u2014 goes a long way.\n[Slide 11] A great team slide. Image Credits: Unito\n[Slide 3] Positioning the company in context. Image Credits: UnitoHumans are narrative-driven. Being able to tell the story of how a startup fits into the broader context is very smart. I have a particular weakness for market evolutions and seeing how verticals change over time. This is Unito\u2019s third slide, and the company is using it to great effect, showing how it can be the obvious next evolution of how SaaS companies talk to each other.\n[Slide 3] Positioning the company in context. Image Credits: Unito\nIt\u2019s important to think about how your company fits into a historic context for your market or industry. This can be a great way to anchor a narrative to previous successful businesses and position yourself within the sector. In some cases, it can take the place of the \u201cwhy now\u201d part of your story.\nUnito started by building a set of sync tools for a specific niche: keeping the tools that product managers use in sync with tools that developers use. That\u2019s a great way to have a specific, well-defined set of tools you have to work with. From there, the company decided to start expanding:\n[Slide 8] Vertical expansion is powerful. Image Credits: UnitoThis type of expansion affects a lot of different things, not least the total addressable market. We usually see this type of expansion geographically: If you have a company that has built a set of solutions for Germany, you might expand to the rest of Europe or globally. Market expansions like this can be equally powerful. It means that the addressable market grows exponentially; adding marketing, contact management and social media to the sync matrix, for example, can open up huge new market opportunities and potential for growth.\n[Slide 8] Vertical expansion is powerful. Image Credits: Unito\nIt makes the same point, but more specifically, on its competition slide:\n[Slide 10] The competition slide reiterates the opportunity. Image Credits: UnitoThis is the type of thing you learn in business school, so it\u2019s great to see it out in the wild. Strategically, the path Unito built makes a lot of sense, and I\u2019m not surprised that this narrative resonated with investors.\n[Slide 10] The competition slide reiterates the opportunity. Image Credits: Unito\nIn the rest of this teardown, we\u2019ll take a look at three things Unito could have improved or done differently, along with its full pitch deck!\n "

But is it really fair to call them that?\nTechCrunch+ recently surveyed a handful of VCs and founders about how they\u2019re feeling about SAFE rounds in this tougher fundraising market, especially now that power has largely shifted back to investors. We found that while both groups championed the deal structure at the earliest stages and for capital raises in between formal rounds, founders seemed less enthused about SAFEs overall.\nIsn\u2019t it a bit odd to be hesitant about something that is supposedly good for you?\nThe SAFE structure can definitely be beneficial to founders. A SAFE with no valuation cap allows founders to have significantly more control over price, it\u2019s quicker to close if you need cash fast, and, hey, it costs less in legal fees.\nBut there are a few things about this deal structure that give me pause. Is a model that is faster and comes with less legal oversight really better for founders who may be taking on money for the first or second time, compared to a VC who looks at deals all day? Indeed, there are several drawbacks to SAFE rounds that can bite founders down the line. "

            "epoch_timestamp": 1690551895.0,
            "title": "AngelList expands into private equity with acquisition of fintech startup Nova",
            "content": "AngelList, an organization that started out by teaming up founders with early-stage investors, is expanding into the private equity space. And it\u2019s acquired a Y Combinator-backed fintech startup in the industry to kickstart that effort.\nFounded in 2010, AngelList started as a mailing list for high-quality angel investors before turning into one of the most powerful fundraising channels for early-stage startups. Over the years, it has evolved its model and today touts itself as an organization that \u201ccreates products and services for venture firms, investors, startups, and fund managers to accelerate innovation.\u201d Earlier this year, venture capitalist Harry Stebbings, host of podcast \u201cThe Twenty Minute VC\u201d podcast, shared his view that AngelList had transitioned from being an SPV (special purpose vehicle) provider to \u201cslowly becoming the software platform for the entire industry venture and startup ecosystem.\u201d\nWith its mid-June acquisition of Nova (only the company\u2019s second buy since inception), which has built investor management software for institutional private funds, AngelList continues to broaden its scope.\nOver the years, for example, AngelList has moved from solely serving micro-funds to launching SPVs to pioneering the concept of rolling funds, which are investment vehicles that raise money through a quarterly subscription from interested investors. Another offering is Stack, a suite of products designed to compete with Carta in providing services to help founders start, operate and maintain ownership over their companies.\u00a0\nThe move into private equity might feel like it\u2019s counter to AngelList\u2019s original venture focus but CEO Avlok Kohli, who took the helm of the company in 2019, told TechCrunch in an exclusive interview that he believes the expansion into private equity was a logical and natural one.\n\u201cAt the highest level, the way to think about what AngelList does is we\u2019re really building the infrastructure that powers the startup economy, including all the infrastructure needed to run venture funds,\u201d he said. \u201cThis includes serving the GPs and LPs in the funds\u2026Over the years, we have continued to move up market.\u201d\nThe expansion is also indicative of the lifecycle of a startup, which typically starts by raising capital from venture funds, Kohli added.\n\u201cAs they mature, the scope of capital providers they can tap into expands into private equity and of course, even the public markets,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, this is expanding the lifecycle of products AngelList can build to serve startups throughout their journey.\u201d\nPradyuman Vig, 26, started Nova out of Austin after selling his previous startup, Asuna, to Swift Media. (Asuna, now known as Legends.ai, was a popular League of Legends statistics website). Nova was designed to help replace subscription paperwork \u201cwith flexible digital workflows that save time and reduce friction.\u201d Among its customers are Van Eck, which has about $78 billion in assets under management; Pantera, which has about $3.5 billion in AUM; Broad Street Global (about $3 billion in AUM); Galaxy (about $2.5 billion in AUM) and BlockTower (which doesn\u2019t disclose AUM).\nNova currently has over 10,000 investors with identities on Nova who invested billions of dollars through the system in the last year, according to Vig. Revenue tripled in 2022 and is on target to grow by 2x this year, they added.\nThe startup will continue to run as a business unit within AngelList and packaged within the Investor Management suite of products within AngelList to help the company expand into the larger private markets industry. Nova\u2019s digital subscriptions offering has been rebranded to AngelList Transact, while its data room and investor portal too will become AngelList products.\u00a0\n\u201cLike Nova, we\u2019ve also seen firsthand the value funds place on replacing disparate products that don\u2019t talk to each other with a unified software stack that just works. We\u2019re integrating Nova\u2019s investor management products with a series of other products we\u2019re building for larger institutional funds such as Treasury and the rest of our software suite,\u201d Kohli said. \u201cAs part of this push to serve institutional funds, we\u2019ve found early success selling to private equity \u2014 given Nova\u2019s historical focus, their customer base significantly expands our presence there and accelerates our growth in the larger private markets industry.\u201d\nThe expansion follows a year of growth for AngelList. According to statistics shared by Kohli exclusively with TechCrunch, assets supported for investors on AngelList increased by 50% to $15 billion year-over-year in 2022. It took six years to reach $1 billion (in 2018), according to Kohli. Also last year, the number of startups funded on AngelList increased by 21% to 8,300. The organization also saw a 19% increase in fund managers in 2022 versus 2021 and a 17% bump in LPs invested into an SPV or fund supported on AngelList.\nWhile Kohli did not reveal hard revenue figures, one can assume that since all these metrics were up in 2022, revenue, too, was up. AngelList makes money through a variety of sources, he said, including subscription & SaaS fees and carried interest.\n\u201cAngelList\u2019s business is pretty diversified at this point. We\u2019re operating at significant scale,\u201d he said. \u201cGoing through a giant downturn basically leaves open the ability to consolidate the market. So AngelList is in a position to consolidate the market.\u201d\nIn March of 2022, AngelList Venture (which became AngelList late last year as it took over the main brand) turned to venture to fund its own growth \u2014 raising a $100 million Series B co-led by Tiger Global and Accomplice at a $4 billion valuation.\u00a0\nSo why didn\u2019t AngelList simply create its own private equity-focused product, rather than buy up a startup? As in the case of many acquisitions, AngelList recognized the value of buying an existing company with established customers. Plus, it already had its own version of a product in its Treasury offering, but even Kohli admits it was not as robust as what Nova developed.\n\u201cWe had a closing flow built out but with Nova, we were able to add more complexity in a good way,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd while AngelList has primarily played in the venture space, and even though venture is a subset of private equity, we saw in Nova and Pradyuman a way to absorb and accelerate our understanding of the PE space. Venture and private equity are closely related cousins in our view.\u201d\nThe acquisition was at least one year in the making, though.\n\u201cWhen Pradyuman and I originally started talking, it was very clear where we\u2019re seeing the world in the same way and at first I was just thinking about having him come in as a leader in the company,\u201d he told TechCrunch. \u201cBut the timing wasn\u2019t right.\u201d\nThe pair kept in touch and the deal, for which financial terms were not disclosed, closed in June.\nNow, Nova is getting integrated into AngelList\u2019s business as part of its new Transact offering \u2014 the latest in a string of recent product releases for the company. It launched its AngelList Treasury offering a few weeks ago, in addition to Projector, a portfolio modeling tool, and, more recently, it launched Relay, an AI-driven portfolio Analyzer tool.\nAngelList very quietly made its first acquisition about 18 months ago \u2014 a brand design agency that included the former head of marketing and design at Square.\nFor now, AngelList is not planning any more acquisitions, but Kohli says the company is open \u2014 for the right fit. Today, AngelList has 130 employees, not including the 50 workers employed by Bell Tower, a fully owned fund and tax administrator. Kohli said he could not comment on how many of Nova\u2019s 12 employees would be joining AngelList.\nNova was technically founded in 2018, and went through YC in the summer of 2018. It raised about $2 million afterwards, led by Justin Kan. It was preempted on a $7 million Series A that closed in July of 2022 and was led by Avichal Garg at Electric Capital.\n\u201cFrom 2018-2021 we were experimenting, and then finally found success in 2021,\u201d Vig told TechCrunch.\nIn 2021, Nova launched its digital subscriptions product that replaced subscription paperwork with digital workflows so that investors would not have \u201cto spend hours sorting through conditionals and unfamiliar questions to complete their investment,\u201d Vig said.\nOnce investors completed a subscription through Nova, they could reuse their Nova Identity on future subscriptions at any other fund that also used the product. The company called this the Nova Network.\u00a0\nLast year, Nova launched a data room product to help its customers market to their investors ahead of the subscription process. And this year, it created an investor portal so that investors can receive documents such as K-1s, see investment performance and make additional investments with Nova as well.\n\u201cBy launching the portal, fund managers are able to handle their entire investor management process in the same system,\u201d Vig said. \u201cWith these three products, our customers are now starting to refer to our product as a full stack Investor CRM \u2014 it\u2019s a message we\u2019ll be doubling down on as part of AngelList.\u201d\nWant more fintech news in your inbox?

            "content": "Women\u2019s healthcare got another capital infusion today in HerMD, which announced $18 million in additional Series A funding, showing that this area continues to be of interest to investors.\nMy colleague Dominic-Madori Davis reported earlier this year that women\u2019s health companies raised about $1.16 billion in 2022. Though down from $1.41 billion in 2021, this is still a vast improvement over the $496 million raised in 2020, according to PitchBook data.\nDr. Somi Javaid, founder and chief medical officer of HerMD. Image Credits: HerMD\nDr. Somi Javaid, founder and chief medical officer of HerMD. Image Credits: HerMD\nHerMD is among a group of companies (for example, Herself Health, Tia Health, Vira Health and Adyn) providing care options specifically for women, at all stages of their lives, and attracting venture capital for their approaches.\nFounder and chief medical officer Dr. Somi Javaid opened the first HerMD location in 2015 in Cincinnati to help change the notion that less than 20% of OBGYNs are trained in menopause and sexual health care. She later brought on Kathy McAleer as CEO in 2022.\nThe company offers comprehensive women\u2019s healthcare, either in-person or virtual, and one of its differentiators is that the average appointment is between 20 and 60 minutes. All medical services are insurance- and Medicare-based. In addition, HerMD provides aesthetic services, including facial injectables and body treatments.\nTo address the lack of training, the company created the HerMD University that centers around proprietary algorithms of care to take providers from classroom to clinic. Providers are able to attend health conferences around menopause and sexual health and participate in monthly meetings.\n\u201cThe first thing we had to fix was the educational component,\u201d Javaid told TechCrunch. \u201cSome providers have told us that they get more education in the first couple of weeks at HerMD University than they have in their entire career. Then we had to give our providers and patients more time.\u201d\nHerMD has around 20 providers between its clinics in Cincinnati, Franklin, Tennessee and Carmel, Indiana and is consistently seeing a waitlist of approximately 500 patients leading up to a clinic opening.\nOne of the areas that Javaid also focuses on is provider experience, explaining that many providers have become burned out in recent years amid the failings of the existing U.S. healthcare system.\n\u201cWe\u2019re in this era where we may lose 47% of our workforce by 2025 because of burnout from COVID, because of lack of mission-driven work and because female providers feel like they can\u2019t climb the ladder as well and there\u2019s a pay gap,\u201d Javaid said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have any of that at HerMD \u2014 it\u2019s equal opportunity. You want to climb the ladder, you climb a ladder. And we give work-life balance, so we have almost zero turnover.\u201d\nHerself Health, providing primary care to women 65 and over, raises $26M\nMeanwhile, the Series A extension was led by existing investor JAZZ with participation from Amboy Street Ventures and B-Flexion. The new investment brings HerMD\u2019s total funding to nearly $30 million.\nWith the funding, the company will expand its brick-and-mortar locations, including the first in the New York City area and a second Nashville-area clinic. HerMD will also continue developing its virtual services and HerMD University and grow its team \u2014 Javaid said there are 100 providers eager to join. The company will also launch mental health services and invest in the latest technologies around sexual health and menopause.\n\u201cWe will also be introducing e-commerce and physician-curated products,\u201d Javaid said. \u201cHospital-based systems, and relationships like that, is another thing that we would love to do. We rely on hospitals for imaging, primary care and obstetric and oncology care, but a lot of hospital systems say they struggle because their providers aren\u2019t trained in menopause and sexual health. They need a partner like us, and I see HerMD having over 200 clinics in the future.\u201d\nDespite 2022\u2019s headwinds, women\u2019s health startups did better than ever before"

            "content": "Meet Pollen, a new French startup that wants to provide a better way to learn new skills. Instead of working with full-time teachers, Pollen invites business executives and top performers in the tech industry so that they can host a class with a small group of people.\nBehind the scenes, Pollen was co-founded by Julie Ranty, the former managing director of Viva Technology, a popular tech conference that takes place every year in Paris, along with Olivier Xu and Vincent Huguet. And Huguet knows a thing or two about marketplaces, as he\u2019s the co-founder and co-CEO of Malt, a freelancer marketplace. He\u2019s still very much focused on Malt, but he contributes to Pollen in a non-operational role.\n\u201cI\u2019m convinced that the best professional training courses today are given by people who aren\u2019t trainers yet. They are working professionals and they are willing to share their secret sauce with you, their experience, their work methodology and highly actionable content \u2014 not just inspiring content, but actionable content for the next day,\u201d Pollen CEO Julie Ranty told me.\nAnd the reason Pollen focuses on the tech industry is because it changes all the time. If you work for a tech company, chances are you are using \u2014 or thinking about using \u2014 generative AI in one way or another. Or you may be trying to implement a new, sophisticated sales method. Or you want to tweak your pricing and monetization strategy.\nPollen has already attracted 40 people working in the tech industry who are hosting classes on Pollen\u2019s behalf. The typical course is a four-hour course followed by a lunch break so you can share tips with other people in a laid-back atmosphere. It can also be an eight-hour all-day course with a lunch break.\nThe company also offers online classes, but most people prefer in-person courses. \u201cWith online classes, it isn\u2019t an eight-hour Zoom tunnel, it\u2019s two-hour blocks spread over two weeks. You get four times two hours over two weeks,\u201d Ranty said.\nThere are four reasons some tech workers accept to create courses for Pollen. First, Pollen takes care of all the pesky tasks that come with becoming an instructor.\n\u201cA solution like Pollen helps you develop your course and, on top of that, manages the whole admin, sales, marketing, customer relations side of things,\u201d Ranty said. \u201cIt also teaches them \u2014 because we\u2019ve developed a Pollen methodology with pedagogical experts \u2014 it also teaches them the fundamentals of how to share their expertise.\u201d\nThe second and third reasons you would want to join Pollen\u2019s group of trainers is that it can personally help you on a professional level because you appear as an expert in your field, and you get to meet other instructors and grow your network.\nFinally, Pollen pays its trainers. \u201cThey\u2019re paid to do this, but it\u2019s definitely not the main reason why they choose to do it,\u201d Ranty said.\nPollen is positioning itself as an upskilling platform for existing companies. It wants to convince HR managers that they should allocate some of their training budget toward Pollen courses.\nIn the coming months, the startup is going to apply for the Qualiopi certification, which means that it\u2019s a serious professional development company that offers high-quality courses. The startup expects to be able to offer 300 different sessions in 2024 \u2014 overall, 3,000 people could attend a Pollen course in 2024."

            "title": "The anatomy of a patent litigation target",
            "content": "Intellectual property (IP) protection can be a vital part of a company\u2019s journey from young upstart to billion-dollar behemoth, safeguarding all its technologists\u2019 hard work while adding to the company\u2019s value for investors or would-be acquirers.\nBut as we\u2019ve seen countless times through the years, IP can also be weaponized.\nPatent wars have been a mainstay of the modern technology era, with some of the world\u2019s biggest companies embroiled in high-profile t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eates, from Apple vs. Samsung, Qualcomm and Nokia, to Google vs. Sonos, Twitter vs. IBM and many more. While some of this patent palaver might well stem from genuine IP infringements, there are many examples of patents being misused purely for financial gain.\nThis is one fear that\u2019s emerging in the aftermath of OpenText\u2019s $6 billion acquisition of Micro Focus, a deal that closed six months ago. We go into the full details of that story here. But the long and short is that OpenText picked up thousands of granted and pending patents through the acquisition; Micro Focus is now giving up its membership of the anti-patent troll membership organization LOT Network; and many are left wondering what happens next. OpenText is no stranger to patent assertion, and it has already been accused of behaving like a patent troll in the wake of its 2019 acquisition of data security firm Carbonite \u2014 a deal that has led to ongoing patent litigation proceedings against CrowdStrike, Kaspersky, Sophos and Trend Micro.\nThis all leads to one question: What does a patent litigation target look like in 2023? And is there anything in particular that might make one company more susceptible to lawsuits than another?\nThe cost that non-practicing entities (NPEs), or \u201cpatent trolls,\u201d have on innovation is sizeable, particularly impacting startups and scale-ups maneuvering through the world of R&D, although long-established billion-dollar companies are far from immune, too.\u00a0\nA report published earlier this year by LOT Network, conducted by IP consultancy Hightech Solutions (HTS), delved into exactly this. The NPE threat: patent sources and litigation target charactertistics explored litigation activity around NPEs from 2017 to 2022, using data provided by Unified Patents related to more than 6,000 defendants sued by NPEs over the period.\nAs you might expect, the likes of Google, Amazon, Samsung and Apple feature highly in the list of defendants most frequently targeted in patent litigation. However, part of the report\u2019s remit was to discover to what extent NPEs pose a threat to smaller companies \u2014 those on the cusp of getting big that may have a lot on the line. These firms might not always have sizeable legal resources at their disposal, either.\nThe data suggests that while \u201clegitimate\u201d patent litigation by operating companies has declined a little in recent years, those instigated by NPEs has \u201cincreased steadily,\u201d due mostly to the number of patent assets \u201cfor sale on the open market and availability of litigation funding.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite common for NPEs, rather than to fund or finance themselves, [to connect] with a litigation financing entity that essentially pays for the litigation and then gets a cut on the assertion,\u201d IP attorney Patrick McBride, who most recently headed up IP programs at Red Hat, explained to TechCrunch. \u201cAnd as you might imagine, that changes the game quite a bit, because the NPE has significant financial resources backing them and what they\u2019re trying to do.\u201d\nRoughly 60% of all patent litigation last year stemmed from NPEs. But the characteristics that make a company \u201cmore or less likely\u201d to be targeted by a frivolous patent lawsuit, as identified in the report, makes for interesting reading.\u00a0\nThe report starts with a hypotheses that NPEs could be motivated by timings related to a company\u2019s IPO. For example, startups approaching a public listing will be keen to settle quickly, while those that have just completed an IPO may have extra capital at their disposal.\u00a0\nOf the 247 companies it identified from NPE litigation targets that went public from 2012 to 2022, 30% of the earliest litigation took place four years or more after the date of the IPO. But by contrast, 39% of the NPE litigation took place in the two years before and after an IPO.\nThe report noted:\nThis finding gives support to the hypothesis we were exploring, and means that the period before and after an IPO is a time of elevated risk that a firm will become the target of one or more NPE lawsuits.\nSelect NPE Litigation (2017-2021) and Financial Data (IPOs from 2012-2022).

Image Credits: HTS / LOT Network\nThe report also suggested that NPEs might take into account funding raised by its targets, with the average number of rounds raised sitting at nearly four \u2014 this means that somewhere around Series C to D stage is attractive to NPEs, with the average funding amount raised prior to the earliest litigation sitting at $65 million.\nThe report added:\nThis all makes sense, in that, in business, it is always more attractive to sue a target that has deep pockets, than one known to be scarce of financial resources.\nSummary of NPE Lawsuits Against Private Companies By Earliest NPE Litigation Date (Funding RoundsAnnounced 2017-2022). Image Credits: HTS / LOT Network\nSummary of NPE Lawsuits Against Private Companies By Earliest NPE Litigation Date (Funding RoundsAnnounced 2017-2022). Image Credits: HTS / LOT Network\nThis data might not tell the full story, of course. Not all litigation threats make it into the public sphere; some might get settled at the earliest possible stage before attracting any attention. But it still supports the notion that patent trolls adopt a fairly targeted approach to their litigation endeavors.\n\u201cNPEs are attracted to money and they want easy money,\u201d McBride said. \u201cThey\u2019re attracted to entities with products in the marketplace that they can analyse and at least make a colorable claim that they are covered by their patents. The more your products are in the marketplace, visible to consumers and such like, the more likely you are to be the target of an assertion.\u201d\nThere are some real-world examples that help to illustrate some of these data points. This includes Cloudflare, which is presently in the midst of fighting a second round of patent litigation that kicked off in 2021 \u2014 roughly two years after the company went public.\nHowever, the web infrastructure giant was initially targeted by a different patent troll in 2017, exactly two years before going public. Rather than acquiescing, Cloudflare went on the offensive and launched a crowdsourced campaign called Project Jengo. This was in response to Blackbird Technologies, a law firm that had managed to acquire dozens of patents before filing lawsuits against several companies, including Cloudflare.\nProject Jengo was (and still is) pitched as a \u201ccontest,\u201d with Cloudflare offering financial rewards to people who help conduct research around prior art to help fight its case. Cloudflare emerged victorious in 2019 just before listing on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), but two years later it was targeted by yet another patent troll. And although some 90% of those assertions made against it were thrown out earlier this year, Cloudflare will have to face some of these claims in court later this year.\nCloudflare general counsel Doug Kramer acknowledged that pre-IPO startups might seem to be a more alluring target for NPEs, but it\u2019s maybe not quite as clear-cut as that.\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure we\u2019ve seen a clear strategy or targeting in the flood of threatening letters and threatened lawsuits pursued by patent trolls,\u201d Kramer explained to TechCrunch. \u201cOnce an NPE gets hold of a patent, it will often send letters to everyone who could plausibly be sued for infringement under that patent \u2014 including very early-stage companies, or even a company that purchases a retail product off the shelf made by a company that the NPE may allege is infringing. They cast a wide net and see what they can reel in.\u201d\nThe alternative to fighting back, according to Kramer, would likely have been to settle for a \u201clow six-figure\u201d sum. However, the bigger concern here was about setting a precedent, encouraging more frivolous claims further down the road.\n\u201cWe really saw the main risk was that we\u2019d be shoveling more coal into the engine of this roaring locomotive,\u201d Kramer said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want to perpetuate that system, and thought there was a way that we could pay more in the short term and try to set up ourselves, and the industry generally, in a better position for the long term.\u201d\nThe fact that Cloudflare\u00a0is facing a second round of patent litigation might suggest that the company\u2019s combative tactics didn\u2019t work as a deterrent. But Kramer argues that it\u2019s more about\u00a0reducing rather than completely\u00a0removing the chances of being targeted.\n\u201cWe definitely think Project Jengo can deter future trolls, both against Cloudflare specifically and against companies generally,\u201d he said. \u201cDeterrents are successful if they diminish the flow of cases, even if not eliminating them entirely. And we\u2019re definitely aware of some claims or threats of claims that were withdrawn when trolls became aware of our practices.\u201d\nAutonomous vehicle startup Oxa (formerly Oxbotica) is one startup that\u2019s approaching a stage that patent trolls might start paying attention to it, having recently closed a $140 million Series C round of funding. The company has filed for around eight patents itself, with one granted at the time of writing.\nAlex Tame, head of licensing and IP management at Oxa, says that although he\u2019s not anticipating patent litigation in the immediate future, things could change as its profile grows.\n\u201cAs a small company in the U.K., we\u2019re probably not really on the radar for many of the \u2018problem\u2019 companies out there,\u201d Tame said. \u201cAs we start to grow and our brand starts to get a bit more kudos, we\u2019re going to be on someone\u2019s radar somewhere.\u201d\nAI companies, including startups similar to Oxa that are working on autonomous vehicles, have been ripe for acquisition these past few years. Part of this has been driven by the need for top technical talent, but IP has also been a central component. When Amazon, for example, doled out a reported $1.2 billion for self-driving automobile startup Zoox back in 2020, it scooped up more than 150 patents, spanning cruise control, signaling and driver assistance technologies, according to Forbes at the time.\nWhile there hasn\u2019t been a great deal of IP litigation in the AI realm generally, we are still in the relatively nascent phase of a fast-growing AI revolution, and things can change quickly as more players look to assert their authority (and IP) over rivals. ChatGPT developer OpenAI is currently in the process of trademarking \u201cGPT\u201d with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), a harbinger perhaps of what\u2019s to come down the road for startups, scaleups and enterprise behemoths trying to get their slice of the trillion-dollar AI pie.\nThis doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that we\u2019re about to see a maelstrom of lawsuits and counter lawsuits, but with the AI hype train gaining steam, companies will at least start to get defensive with their IP measures so that they have some basis for protecting themselves. This isn\u2019t limited to patents, but trademarks, copyright and all the rest.\nThis is partly why one of Tame\u2019s first tasks when he joined Oxa in 2019 was to set up the company with membership in LOT Network, the nonprofit coalition that protects member companies by automatically cross-licensing their patents if they fall into the hands of a patent assertion entity (PAE \u2014 a similar concept to an NPE, which LOT defines as an entity that derives more than half of its income from patent enforcement). LOT counts thousands of members, including some of Oxa\u2019s deeper-pocketed rivals.\n\u201cWe aren\u2019t in an industry that \u2014 at the moment \u2014 is going to be litigious,\u201d Tame said. \u201cWe\u2019re not an industry that\u2019s going to start picking fights with each other, though that may come later. You look at who the members are of the LOT Network, and most of our competitors are in the network. So it was a bit of a no brainer \u2014 if we joined the LOT Network, we get some protection from [the likes of] Google and Uber and Aurora.\u201d (Though this protection only extends to scenarios where LOT members\u2019 patents fall into the hands of a NPE/PAE.)\nWhile there might not always be a cogent or consistent strategy in the patent troll playbook, it appears that there is something of a sweet spot in terms of what an ideal litigation or licensing target looks like. Sure, Google or Intel might be juicy targets, but they\u2019re also well-resourced and well-versed in addressing litigation.\n\u201cThe thing to understand about NPEs is they are not about the merits of their invention, they are about negotiating leverage to maximize the money they get \u2014 that\u2019s the game they are playing,\u201d McBride said. \u201cAnd so when you are a pre-IPO company, or you are a small company wishing to be privately acquired, you are in a vulnerable state.\u201d\nThe idea is that any pre-IPO company that might be subject to due diligence, either ahead of a public listing, funding round or potential acquisition, will want that inspection to go as smoothly as possible. Any lingering litigation, spurious or not, is a major red-flag in the due diligence process. Thus patent trolls could be attracted to such scenarios, since the startup might be a little more willing to settle the case.\n\u201cI have done due diligence on companies that were hoping to be acquired, they were subject to an NPE assertion or litigation and that killed the deal,\u201d McBride said. \u201cThe NPEs know this, and specifically time their attacks for just such an event.\u201d"

            "content": "Universe, the no-code mobile website builder, announced today that it\u2019s launching an AI-powered website designer in beta. The designer, called GUS (Generative Universe Sites), can help anyone build and launch a custom website from their iOS device.\nOnce you get started with GUS, you will enter the familiar Universe grid editor. Instead of starting with a template, you start a text conversation with GUS to begin creating your website. GUS will start by asking: \u201cWhat kind of website would you like to build today?\u201d Once you give GUS some initial details about the type of website you would like to build, GUS will ask you for a bit of information about what exactly you\u2019re looking for. For instance, GUS may ask if you have a specific design or color scheme in mind, or if you have an idea of how many pages you would like on the website.\nAfter you give GUS details about your vision for the website, GUS will create a layout for you. The layout is completely editable, as you can manually change things without having to touch any bits of code. For instance, if you want to change an image that GUS selected, you can go in and swap it with a different one. Once you\u2019re happy with what you see, you can go ahead and publish your website.\n\u201cWhen we set out to develop what would ultimately become Universe, our mission was clear \u2013 to empower anyone to build the internet,\u201d said Universe founder and CEO Joseph Cohen in a statement. \u201cGenerative AI lets us do this at an entirely new level: just tell GUS what\u2019s in your mind and it\u2019ll build it for you. Now, everyone on our iOS app can try the GUS beta. We hope we can give everyone the confidence and design support\u2014from tattoo artists to general contractors to students to pragmatists to visionaries\u2014to claim their corner of the internet with the computer they already carry around in their pocket every day.\u201d\nThe GUS beta is currently available to all users who update their Universe app on iOS. Universe plans to bring the experience to the web in the near future to give users without an iPhone or those who prefer desktop the ability to access GUS.\nUniverse\u2019s new tool is similar to one launched by Wix earlier this month, which is called the\u00a0AI Site Generator. The tool\u00a0allows users to describe their intent and generate a website complete with a homepage, inner pages and text and images \u2014 as well as business-specific sections for events, bookings and more.\nOne of the main ideas behind both companies\u2019 products is to help small and medium-sized businesses launch and maintain websites to drive sales, which can be a challenging process. For context, a 2022 survey\u00a0by Top Design Firms, a directory for finding creative agencies, found that nearly 27% of small businesses still don\u2019t have a website and that low traffic, followed by adding \u201cadvanced\u201d functionalities and cost, are the top challenges they face with their website.\nOf course, the products aren\u2019t only geared and marketed toward business-owners, as they can be used by anyone to create a website easily.\n\u201cUniverse continues to champion inclusivity and accessibility in web design, and GUS marks a significant milestone in this journey,\u201d Universe wrote in a press release. \u201cWith its AI-powered capabilities, GUS opens doors for individuals from all walks of life to bring their creative visions to life on the digital canvas.\u201d\nFounded in 2014, Universe has raised $47.3 million in funding to date, according to Crunchbase. The company raised $30 million in December 2021 as part of its Series B round from Google Ventures, Javelin Venture Partners, Box Group and more. Universe closed a $10 million Series A from Google Ventures back in April 2020."

Proprio\u2019s technology reinvents the way surgeons see, understand and influence the contours of bone and tissue, improving outcomes and potentially saving lives.\nThis isn\u2019t a compact X-ray machine or a cheaper MRI. It\u2019s a live aid to a surgery in which precision and accurate, up-to-date information about the patient is crucial. The promise of the technology has also attracted investment: the company today announced $43 million in new funding.\nSpinal deformation happens when a condition, trauma or habit causes the natural curvature of the spine to assume outsized or distorted proportions. The most frequent cause is probably scoliosis, which progressively warps the spine and if left untreated can lead to serious disability. To combat this, the spine is fitted with a custom metal frame, attached with screws, that restricts and corrects this tendency, shepherding the vertebrae into a more healthy arrangement.\nIt\u2019s not unlike getting braces \u2014 if teeth were sealed inside the body and there was a millimeter\u2019s breadth between curing and paralyzing the patient. Spinal corrective surgery is commonplace (about 1.6 million of this type are performed yearly) and effective, but it\u2019s also incredibly difficult and specialized work.\nAnd while new tools have emerged over the years to make it safer and more likely to succeed, a given procedure may still require a dozen X-rays and other scans, and the methods of virtually augmenting surgeons\u2019 own senses are stuck in the past.\nAn example of a scoliotic spine before and after corrective surgery. Image Credits: Proprio\nAn example of a scoliotic spine before and after corrective surgery. Image Credits: Proprio\nDetailed interior imagery is needed for prep, but by the time they\u2019re in the operating room, the images they have of the patient may be days or weeks old, and for acute conditions or trauma especially this is a huge problem. If the imagery doesn\u2019t match reality, not only could something have happened in the patient\u2019s body, but there\u2019s an increased risk of harm working with outdated info.\nIf the surgeon senses that the situation may have changed, the patient must be put inside an imaging machine and everyone must clear the room. Imagine doing that mid-surgery, with all that entails! Not only is it disruptive to the procedure and time-consuming, it leads to multiple radiation doses for the patient and the surgeon, who is repeatedly exposed to this process.\nA surgeon conducts an operation with a Proprio Paradigm device overhead. Image Credits: Proprio\nA surgeon conducts an operation with a Proprio Paradigm device overhead. Image Credits: Proprio\nProprio is a startup that aims to completely change how this and other procedures are accomplished by, mapping detailed pre-operative scans to a real-time 3D representation of the patient\u2019s anatomy, running through a complex suite of sensors that monitor movements and changes at a sub-millimeter level.\nThe company\u2019s first product, Paradigm, is a real-time surgery guidance device comprising a complex multi-camera imager and a display that shows exactly what a surgeon needs to know in order to drive a screw down the exact trajectory necessary to attach the brace without splitting the vertebra or piercing the spinal cord and crippling the patient.\nTo do this, it performs a hyper-precise version of what your phone might do for an augmented reality app, which tracks the space and objects around you to place a virtual character or piece of furniture in the desired place. Though there are some systems that do something like this already, they rely on combining static, pre-operative imagery with a physical marker as a reference point. Essentially, they don\u2019t track the physiology of the patient, but rather the marker itself, meaning the position of the vertebrae, etc. \u2014 a confident guess rather than observed fact.\nIt also means if the person shifts, or the surgery is delayed, or for any other reason the imagery becomes out of date or misaligned, the systems cease to be effective \u2014 remember, being off by even a tiny amount is disastrous; neurosurgery isn\u2019t a discipline where people just eyeball it.\nProprio\u2019s device leapfrogs these methods through very, very precise imaging and computer vision. The \u201cPrism\u201d imaging array has half a dozen sensors in it, including multiple RGB cameras, infrared stereo cameras and a dedicated depth sensor.\nI visited the Proprio office in Seattle and saw a live simulated procedure and some development prototypes. CEO and co-founder Gabriel Jones and co-founder Jim Youngquist answered my various questions, though I did not take their answers down verbatim.\nPediatric neurosurgeon, co-founder and Chief Medical Officer Dr. Samuel Browd seemed genuinely excited and relieved by the promise of the tech; obviously it\u2019s his company, but it was clear to me that he considered his first duty to be to his patients, and thought of the Proprio approach as a long-awaited game-changer.\nExamples of real-time imagery during a simulated procedure. Image Credits: Proprio\nExamples of real-time imagery during a simulated procedure. Image Credits: Proprio\nParadigm also works with pre-operative imagery, but not static images of the positions and orientations of vertebrae. Instead, the vertebra are rendered in 3D as the movable, dynamic objects they are, and the imaging unit can observe and \u201cregister\u201d their positions in real time, no marker necessary. (The company\u2019s \u201clight field\u201d talk may ring a bell \u2014 and indeed former Lytro engineer Thomas Nonn works on Paradigm.)\nSo if the patient moves, or needs to be moved, or for whatever reason the vertebrae are not exactly where they were when the MRI was taken\u2026 no problem. The system tracks them continuously in 3D space by minutely observing the exposed surfaces and other factors. While accuracy is not an easy metric to track down in such a variable context, the company did say it was at the \u201csub-millimeter\u201d level.\nHow this is done is part of the company\u2019s secret sauce \u2014 I saw several prototypes from their development process, with different numbers and configurations of cameras. The final design for Paradigm incorporates the best of those and is also, of course, all set up for work in an operating room.\nProprio in April received 510(k) clearance from the FDA, which is not a full green light exactly, but rather like saying you have an improved version of something already on the market that doesn\u2019t add any new risks. In this case it\u2019s devices for \u201cstereotaxic navigation for spine surgery,\u201d and the company \u201cperformed many usability and performance studies with everything from benchtop models to porcine samples and human cadavers.\u201d\nIts next step, then, is to commercialize the platform by putting it in as many operating rooms as possible and taking on its first in-human cases. That involves a lot of manufacturing, testing, training and support \u2014 few surgical aids are \u201cset it and forget it\u201d type devices. That said, they expect the first procedures to happen this summer at partnering hospitals.\nThe Proprio Paradigm device, and the door to the company\u2019s \u201cprecision lab.\u201d Image Credits: Proprio\nThe Proprio Paradigm device, and the door to the company\u2019s \u201cprecision lab.\u201d Image Credits: Proprio\nBut while spinal surgery navigation is the first and clearest application of the technology, it may well only be the company\u2019s opening move. There is, of course, the potential to apply the device\u2019s capabilities to other difficult surgeries \u2014 while it was built with spinal procedures in mind, the same method would be helpful in, say, joint reconstruction.\nYet even greater value might emerge from the inevitable \u201cdata play,\u201d though surgery is an area where such a play is desperately needed. Training new surgeons is a long and difficult process, and there is a distinct lack of rich data pertaining to any given procedure. There may be video, or not, of varying quality and recency. But high-fidelity collection and analysis of operations is less common than you\u2019d think, and what\u2019s out there is limited in other ways.\nThe Paradigm imager collects an enormous amount of data, which can be put to use in countless ways (of course all staying well within patient confidentiality laws and ethics). Training is an obvious one, but the team also showed how, by combining data from hundreds of previous surgeries and outcomes with real-time tracking of the patient, a prediction or projection of how a procedure might be improved. It may not be obvious even to an expert eye, but placement of a screw a millimeter over, or tightening a wire by a hair more, could be the difference between requiring a follow-up surgery or not.\nThere\u2019s also the possibility of tracking the surgeons and tools themselves; if complications occur, for instance, the procedure can be watched start to finish in high fidelity 3D, and the cause of the problems made clear in retrospect. And for the inevitable questions of insurance, malpractice and so on, it could also be used to show clearly that an instrument was used properly, or not used at all, or that it was this person and not that one who made a mistake.\nWhile these capabilities are notional right now (videos I was shown were mockups), they\u2019re certainly possible, but with a device like the Paradigm looking down on every surgery and producing an enormous body of data. While the concept may seem a bit repulsive from outside the OR, Dr. Browd seemed to think it would save many lives and make these procedures faster, better and cheaper.\nData-driven healthcare goes beyond electronic records and telehealth \u2014 and even robotic surgeries. There\u2019s room for technology to make many procedures better for both patient and surgeon, if the understandable reticence to part with tried-and-true methods can be overcome.\nThe company\u2019s $43 million B round came from new and existing investors DCVC, BOLD Capital Partners, Bird B. AG, Cota Capital, Intel and HTC."

            "content": "Pet ownership exploded during the global pandemic, and veterinarians are still struggling to keep up with demand.\nIn fact, a Mars Veterinary Health report from 2022 highlighted a need for more than 41,000 vets to enter the industry over the next decade in order to meet demand. Not enough people are going into this field, which means there will be an estimated shortage of 15,000 veterinarians by 2030.\nPet telehealth company Airvet is out to help them, buoyed by $18.2 million in new Series B funding. We last profiled the company in 2020 when it raised its $14 million Series A round.\nCEO Brandon Werber, whose father is well-known vet Dr. Jeff Werber, started the company in 2018 to connect pet parents with practicing veterinarians for telehealth visits any day, any time.\n\u201cThe vet shortage is going to make it very expensive and very, very difficult to get care for your pets when they\u2019re sick,\u201d Werber said. \u201cSo many vets today are not taking new clients at all. They\u2019re just telling you to go find another vet, go to an urgent care or an ER. The problem is most people can\u2019t afford impromptu trips to the vet. It\u2019s really expensive.\u201d\nIndeed, with U.S. pet care estimated to grow from $118 billion in 2019 to $277 billion by 2030, all of this need provides an opportunity for technology to help.\nNot only has that attracted startups, but venture capitalists as well.\nCompanies like Digitail, Mixlab, The Vets and Dutch, to name a few, came on in recent years with solutions to help vets. Newer startups are coming in as well: Mascotte Health, a UAE-based veterinary service provider, announced $1.2 million in pre-seed funding this month, while Maven Pet recently raised $3 million to use AI to detect early onset of serious illnesses in dogs and cats, according to Guilherme Coelho, co-founder and CEO.\nHowever, even with the need for more veterinarian services, not every company\u2019s business model has succeeded. For example, Fuzzy, a company that created a digital pet care network of veterinary professionals, and raised $80 million in venture-backed funding since its founding in 2016, reportedly shut down in June.\nAirvet, a telehealth veterinary platform, just clawed its way to a $14 million Series A round\nWatching what happened to Fuzzy, and trying to keep a company going amid a market shift, put things into perspective, Werber said.\n\u201cWhen the markets shifted, it put back into focus that you can\u2019t just build fast and recklessly,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to build with an eye and a path towards profitability, healthy margins, healthy unit economics and building a real scalable business. We had to take hard looks at our model and our strategy.\u201d\nBusiness approaches in the pet tech space run the gambit, but have largely focused on direct-to-consumer healthcare or helping veterinarians more easily manage their practices amid the demand.\nFor Airvet\u2019s part, Werber said he saw an opportunity to target business-to-business. The company has since built up a base of employer clients, including Adobe, Ceridian and Rexford Industrial, eager to offer an employer-sponsored benefit for employees with pets.\nWerber declined to go into specifics about customer or revenue growth, but said he expects Airvet to reach over 50 customers in the next year and that revenue was \u201cgrowing at a faster rate than before.\u201d\nMeanwhile, the company\u2019s Series B round was led by Mountain Group Partners with participation from Canvas Ventures, Headline, Burst Capital and a group of strategic investors, including VCA Animal Hospitals founder Bob Antin. This gives Airvet just over $33 million in total funding. As part of the investment, Byron Smith, managing director at Mountain Group Partners, will join the company\u2019s board.\nThe funding will support the continued expansion of Airvet\u2019s partnership with enterprise and employer clients, on product development and to build out the company\u2019s sales and marketing teams.\n\u201cThe biggest plans for us now are to really build this category into a ubiquitous category for all employers and enterprises who want to acknowledge, support and celebrate pet families and provide services and resources for them in areas where they are really struggling,\u201d Werber said. \u201cA big part of that is access and affordability of pet care.\u201d\nDeal Dive: Caraway shows what else digital health can do"

            "content": "GlossGenius, a platform designed to handle bookings and payments for salons and spas, today announced that it raised $28 million in a Series C funding round led by L Catterton with participation from Bessemer Venture Partners and Imaginary Ventures.\nThe round values GlossGenius at $510 million \u2014 the startup\u2019s second up-round in the past 12 months \u2014 and brings GlossGenius\u2019 total raised to ~$70 million. Founder and CEO Danielle Cohen-Shohet says that it\u2019ll be put toward developing additional products to support business owners in the beauty and wellness sectors, as well as \u201cinvesting in core areas of the GlossGenius team.\u201d\n\u201cAs one of the fastest-growing software companies in the space now powering billions of dollars of annual transaction activity, GlossGenius has become a critical gateway for success and social mobility for business owners that have traditionally been underserved by technology,\u201d Cohen-Shohet told TechCrunch in an email interview.\nCohen-Shohet founded New York-based GlossGenius in 2016, after experiencing the pain points of managing a makeup artistry business and engaging with clients. Prior to starting the company, she and her twin sister, Leah, ran a digital receipts point-of-sale venture that they launched in college. Those experiences served as a springboard for Danielle, who learned how to code to build GlossGenius\u2019 MVP.\n\u201cGiven the many responsibilities that business owners have, they spend countless hours on time-consuming administrative work and processes that keep them from scaling themselves and revenue,\u201d Cohen-Shohet said. \u201cOur product gives businesses complete control over their business, ultimately enabling them to scale themselves and build a unique brand identity and client experience in the same sophisticated way that larger companies would.\u201d\nGlossGenius, similar to software like Toast, ServiceTitan and Procore, is a vertical software embedded payments app \u2014 but one aimed exclusively at the beauty and wellness spaces. Businesses can use the platform to manage workflows across their back and front offices, including flows related to payments, booking, inventory expenses and marketing.\nGlossGenius also offers a card reader, the design of which businesses can customize to match their branding.\n\u201cHistorically, salon, spa and wellness business owners have had limited options \u2014 manual tracking with pen and paper or complex, general one-size-fits-all horizontal solutions or hard-to-use legacy solutions,\u201d Cohen-Shohet said. \u201cMany of these options have led to commoditization of small businesses, stripping any opportunity for customization, brand-identity or personality.\u201d\nBusinesses that choose not to adopt booking tech, though, run the risk of losing out on new clients. According to a 2019 survey of around 1,000 salon and spa customers, only 54% book appointments during a salon\u2019s and spa\u2019s opening hours. Respondents to the poll also cited online booking as the most important feature when visiting a salon\u2019s website.\nWhether for fear of missing out on new business or other post-pandemic-related reasons, GlossGenius\u2019 customer base has continued to expand pretty consistently. Cohen-Shohet claims that over 60,000 spas and beauty salons are now using GlossGenius\u2019 platform, which is handling billions of dollars in activity annually.\nGlossGenius\u2019 booking and payments management platform for spas and salons. Image Credits: GlossGenius\nGlossGenius\u2019 booking and payments management platform for spas and salons. Image Credits: GlossGenius\nIt helps that, even before the COVID-19 health crisis, spa and salon owners were showing a willingness to adopt new technologies to drive revenue. A 2019 survey of close to 600 spa and salons in the U.S. found that marketing software, point-of-sales systems and cloud software were the top three areas of investment.\n\u201cUpon re-opening [after the pandemic], we witnessed increased demand for digital products that could help business owners in our space run better businesses,\u201d she added. \u201cDespite a broader slowdown in tech that many companies are seeing, we\u2019ve seen our sector show resilience and continued growth.\u201d\nWhile GlossGenius\u2019 growth is impressive, it\u2019s up against formidable competition. Fresha, which also sells a beauty and wellness booking platform and marketplace, raised $100 million in 2022. That same year, appointment booking app Booksy landed $70 million. Meanwhile, booking vendor Boulevard similarly secured $70 million in a funding round that closed in late 2022.\nIt\u2019s cutthroat. Data from Semrush, cited by Fast Company, shows that 76% of the appointment booking market\u2019s online traffic goes to the top five players in the space: Vagaro, Booksy, Mindbody, Styleseat and Fresha.\nGlossGenius\u2019 challenge going forward will be continuing to stand out as the field grows increasingly crowded.\nL Catterton\u2019s Ian Friedman, unsurprisingly, has faith.\n\u201cGiven our deep expertise in the beauty space and our investments in disruptive software businesses across consumer verticals, we see a compelling opportunity ahead to serve businesses here with better and more powerful tech,\u201d he said via email. \u201cThe overwhelming enthusiasm displayed by GlossGenius\u2019s customers is a testament to the product\u2019s excellence and the company\u2019s position as the go-to platform in the industry.\u201d"

            "title": "Patently messy: How a $6B deal may spur more IP lawsuits",
            "content": "A megabucks enterprise acquisition that closed six months ago could lead to thousands of patents landing on the open market.\nLast August, Canadian enterprise technology giant OpenText announced plans to acquire U.K.-based IT software vendor and consultancy Micro Focus for a chunky $6 billion, a deal that closed on January 31. In our coverage at the time, TechCrunch considered various takes on what it might mean for their respective customers, and the motivations behind the deal.\nChief among them, Micro Focus\u2019s assets would help OpenText diversify its product suite and become a stickier proposition. But there are fears that OpenText also could capitalize on something else: a windfall of thousands of patents amassed by Micro Focus.\nNow, with Micro Focus set to end its membership of anti-patent troll organization LOT Network next week, the big question will be: What will OpenText do next?\nOver a period of nearly 50 years, Micro Focus racked up a catalog of thousands of patents both through internal R&D \u2014 it started as an early pioneer in COBOL \u2014 and acquisitions. Its procurement history included legacy software companies such as Borland, Novell (via its 2014 Attachmate acquisition), Serena Software and certain software assets of HPE.\nEven as recently as the months before, during and after OpenText\u2019s approach in August 2022, Micro Focus had dozens of patents granted through applications it had made years earlier, spanning everything from machine learning-based network device profiling and stateless password management to blockchain-based transaction methods.\nBack in 2021, however, Micro Focus had joined LOT Network, a nonprofit outfit that promises to protect its members through an agreement that automatically cross-licenses patents that fall into the hands of patent assertion entities (PAEs). Such PAEs \u2014 also called non-practicing entities (NPEs) or more commonly \u201cpatent trolls\u201d \u2014 are organizations that make most of their revenue through patent enforcement, shell companies set up to assert those rights with no tangible products or R&D associated with the patents.\nThe LOT Network counts thousands of members: Google, Amazon, Uber, Salesforce, Facebook, Microsoft, eBay, Netflix, Airbnb, ByteDance and IBM, though there are plenty of smaller companies in there too, from fledgling startups to pre-IPO scale-ups. The idea is that when a company joins LOT, it commits to ensuring that none of its patents end up in the hands of a PAE. If the patents do end up there, then all LOT members are automatically granted a license to the patents, making them immune to future litigation in perpetuity for as long as they remain members of LOT \u2014 even if the patent holder itself leaves LOT.\nThis arrangement isn\u2019t designed to deter patent enforcement in general \u2014 there are many legitimate scenarios that may require member companies to assert their IP rights. In fact, there are examples of LOT Network members suing one another for patent infringement, for example Google\u2019s sibling Waymo\u2019s suing Uber for trade secret theft, and IBM pursuing Airbnb for patent infringements for some six years, eventually settling the case in 2020.\nThese kinds of patent assertions are fine under LOT\u2019s terms. This is because the companies involved aren\u2019t PAEs, which it defines as any company that derives more than half of its revenues from patent enforcement (litigation or licensing).\nIn other words, LOT is essentially a deterrent mechanism more than anything else, discouraging would-be trolls from snapping up patents for the express purpose of litigation or licensing. Companies are free to end their LOT membership at any point, with the understanding that they will no longer be protected from PAE patent litigation.\nBut on the flip-side, this also frees them to do whatever they want with their patents, including selling them to the highest bidder \u2014 whoever that may be.\nThe anatomy of a patent litigation target\nAll this leads us back to OpenText, which now owns thousands of granted and pending patents, aggregating its own holdings with those of its recent acquisition.\nNotably, Micro Focus officially handed in its resignation notice to LOT Network in March, though in reality the resignation was somewhat moot as LOT\u2019s T&Cs state that when a member is acquired, the acquiring company has to join the organization to remain covered. If this doesn\u2019t happen, the membership is automatically cancelled six months from the acquisition date \u2014 which, in this case, is July 31. (OpenText has never been a member of the LOT Network.)\nWhat this means is that Micro Focus (and thus its patents) will no longer be subject to the LOT Network agreement, and OpenText will be free to use them however it wants. LOT members who joined before Micro Focus\u2019s exit date (July 31) will continue to be protected regardless. But from August 1 onwards, any other company could be a potential litigation or licensing target should the patents end up in the hands of a PAE.\nWhile LOT Network membership would be irrelevant if OpenText were to decide to assert these patents itself \u2014 remember, it\u2019s a legitimate operating company \u2014 there is always a danger that these patents could be sold on to another entity, including a patent troll.\n\u201cWe think there\u2019s a possibility that in the future, one way OpenText might choose to deal with these patents would be to sell them to a PAE,\u201d LOT Network\u2019s VP of partnerships and thought leadership Sam Wiley said in an interview with TechCrunch.\nWiley isn\u2019t alone in voicing concerns. IP attorney Patrick McBride, who most recently headed up IP programs at Red Hat, said that while it\u2019s impossible to know how these patents might be leveraged, OpenText likely has something specific in mind for them.\n\u201cOne would assume that the reason they are removing those assets from the LOT Network is to do something with them, as they would be free to use them for their own operating company purposes while staying in the network,\u201d McBride said. \u201cYou have to conclude that they have some purpose in mind for them by withdrawing them.\u201d\nTechCrunch reached out to OpenText for comment, but was told that it doesn\u2019t comment on business decisions such as this.\nPAE concerns aside, though, recent behavior indicates that OpenText might in fact be open to asserting these patents itself, with litigation one possible outcome.\nOpenText makes most of its annual revenue through its business, which involves helping companies manage their content and data. Over the past decade, its market cap has roughly tripled to more than $11 billion. A chunk of this growth has been off the back of buying legacy software companies, securing countless patents along the way. But some of its actions in recent times have led to accusations that it\u2019s behaving like a patent troll itself.\nBack in 2019, OpenText acquired Carbonite, a data security firm that itself had acquired a 25-year-old endpoint security company called Webroot earlier that same year. Fast-forward to March 2022, and Webroot (backed by its parent OpenText) initiated patent litigation proceedings against CrowdStrike, Kaspersky, Sophos and Trend Micro, with claims that its cybsersecurity rivals were using malware detection techniques protected by patents owned by Webroot.\nA CrowdStrike spokesperson said at the time that this is something it would \u201cexpect from a patent troll\u201d rather than a cybersecurity company. \u201cLegitimate licensing discussions start with a phone call, not a lawsuit,\u201d they said.\nTrend Micro COO Kevin Simzer echoed this sentiment, saying that \u201cdesperate times call for desperate measures\u201d from OpenText.\n\u201cPerhaps OpenText is struggling with the less-than-successful assets they have acquired over the years, so they need to transform into a patent troll type of company,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will vigorously defend ourselves.\u201d\nGoing further back, OpenText has something of a history of patent litigation, settling with rival Alfresco back in 2014 before going after cloud storage company Box and its government procurement partner Carahsoft in 2015. It also currently has litigation against Alfresco\u2019s parent Hyland Software over patents covering remote data-storage technology.\n\u201cOpenText is definitely not a PAE \u2014 it makes most of its money from technology,\u201d Wiley said. \u201cBut compared to its peers, especially on the cybersecurity side, they\u2019re pretty aggressive with patent licensing.\u201d\nData from Clarivate\u2019s Darts IP database, cited by LOT Network, indicates that OpenText has asserted in the region of 40 patents, spanning 19 separate patent litigations, in the past decade.\nWhile the main motive behind buying Micro Focus might well be its ability to generate more direct revenue for its new parent, it\u2019s clear from OpenText\u2019s recent past that patent litigation is on its agenda. And Micro Focus adds significant ammunition to its arsenal, with LOT Network estimating that Micro Focus essentially doubles OpenText\u2019s patent trove. This trove isn\u2019t cheap to administer, either.\nFigures derived from Clarivate\u2019s Innography suggests that Micro Focus has been paying as much as $3 million each year to manage its patent portfolio, which may include registering or renewing patents, monitoring their use (or misuse) across hundreds or thousands of markets. So one way to reduce these overheads, while simultaneously making money, would be to sell some of these patents to a third-party, such as a PAE.\n\u201cIf you look at OpenText\u2019s patent portfolio, it\u2019s probably much larger than it needs to be,\u201d Wiley added. \u201cThose portfolios are very expensive to maintain, you have to pay maintenance to all the different patent offices. And so one possibility would be that OpenText says, \u2018Hey, the best way to get a return on these patents is to sell to a PAE.'\u201d\nThis may also tie in with other cost-cutting measures OpenText announced post-acquisition, which effectively translated into an 8% workforce reduction to save $400 million in outgoings.\nMicro Focus International PLC: Active patents, annual spend.

Image Credits: Clarivate / LOT Network\nIf patent litigation is on the agenda, OpenText might pursue its own route, but there are inherent risks associated with that. An operating company might not want to get too litigious, given the inherent costs, uncertainties and reputational risks associated with that. In which case, selling at least some to a PAE might be a better option in the long run.\nEither way, though, when you consider that OpenText has proactively removed Micro Focus from LOT, and has been actively engaging in litigation to loud cries of \u201cpatent trolls,\u201d this could spell trouble for some companies out there."

            "content": "As one of the well-known data and cloud martech companies in Africa, Terragon, via several products, gives its clients (primarily telecommunications and financial services companies) data on the continent\u2019s growing consumer markets.\nAdrenaline, one of its main products, is a telco-data monetization solution that lets telcos diversify their income and marketers access specialized audiences otherwise unavailable through traditional marketing channels. Finally, these tools enable Terragon corporate clients to drill down on various combinations of behavioral and demographic information, reach consumers via multiple channels both online and offline and link to various touch points, including online sales and payment systems.\nThe cloud analytics and marketing platform earned $5 million in Series A funding in 2018, which it utilized to further develop Adrenaline into the Terragon Marketing Cloud with over 150 million segmented profiles in Nigeria. Today, the firm, which converts telco channels into mobile advertising inventory, announced a $9 million Series B round to expand its focus on offering mobile B2C messaging backed by deep consumer insights from \u201cbig data.\u201d The round was led by Orange Ventures with participation from TLcom Capital, LoftyInc, Sango Capital, VestedWorld and Western Technology Investment (WTI).\nThe investment, according to the business, would allow it to strengthen cloud-native capabilities on its platform as well as develop and accelerate localized ML and AI to provide the foundations for increased enterprise communication. The company hopes to kickstart its Pan-African expansion (which it is already doing in Ghana and Kenya), according to founder and CEO Elo Umeh in an interview with TechCrunch. Umeh said that the growth investment, together with interest from French telecom giants and collaborations with AWS and Microsoft, lends credence to Africa\u2019s market maturity in cloud and martech.\nIn February, four of Europe\u2019s largest carriers (Germany\u2019s Deutsche Telekom, France\u2019s Orange, Spain\u2019s Telef\u00f3nica, and the U.K.\u2019s Vodafone) formed a joint venture to target mobile consumers with opt-in advertising. Furthermore, these telcos want to use this partnership (TrustPid) to capitalize on high-level changes to the third-party tracking cookie status quo in order to generate ad income by developing cross-operator ad-targeting infrastructure based on first-party data.\nGoogle has said that third-party cookies would be phased out to improve user privacy. According to the ad giant, third-party cookies violate users\u2019 privacy by allowing websites to follow them without their knowledge. The elimination of third-party cookies will have several consequences for the online advertising industry, as advertisers will no longer be able to track users across multiple websites, and they will need to find new ways to collect, analyze, and tailor customer data to provide personalized ads and experiences to customers.\nBusinesses will need to integrate various identification solutions instead of relying on third-party cookies to achieve this. And, to accurately profile customers, a central Customer Data Platform (CDP) that relies on a first-party data source (like TrustPid) and combines this with other online data sources appears to be the solution, similar to what Terragon has done with various telcos in the African market for several years, including MTN Nigeria.\nAfrican VC TLcom Capital invests $5M in Nigerian data analytics firm Terragon Group\nSo how did Terragon develop something that Europe is playing catch-up on? The development of Adrenaline was aided by Africa being a mobile-first continent. Since email addresses, and not mobile phone numbers, have traditionally been the unique identifiers for digital services in Europe, this has limited the multiple sources that can be harnessed by solutions like TrustPid to identify and track customers. As a result, Europe and the Global North generally find themselves on the back foot.\nAs a mobile-only continent, Africa has experienced significant internet connectivity growth in recent years. Nearly half a billion users subscribe to mobile services in Africa, and mobile numbers remain the unique identifiers for digital services, as many users do not have email addresses. So, in signing up for platforms like Jumia and Netflix, customers use their phone numbers, not email addresses, like in Europe. Therefore, this structure (including Terragon\u2019s DSP, which is connected to major online publishers, including Google ad exchange) allows advertisers and marketers on the continent to continue running targeting customer engagements required.\n\u201cWe placed a bet on the mobile phone number as a unique ID. In other parts of the world, most of the unique IDs have been email. Digital advertising has been driven by email up to three years or four years ago because that\u2019s the evolution in the West. But now we\u2019re seeing a migration from email to mobile phone numbers because of trends in emerging markets,\u201d Umeh said on the call. \u201cAnd Europe is noticing an intersection between what happens on the mobile phone and eventually what will happen in enterprises because retail media has grown astronomically. So how can they solve for privacy? By coming closer to the supply side (telcos), and changing the unique identifier to the mobile phone number because that is what Facebook, Google and others are using. When the European platform comes on stream, I think the entire world will migrate to it.\u201d\nNonetheless, it\u2019s worth noting that Africa has less stringent comprehensive privacy regulations for consumers than Europe, making it easier for Terragon to grow its services on the continent. Umeh stated that the company\u2019s revenue has risen 10x since its Series A in 2018, with a 100% year-over-year growth rate projected until 2023.\nMicrosoft, Unilever, Access, Fidelity, and FCMB are among Terragon\u2019s partners and clients, as well as telecoms such as MTN. According to Umeh, the company has a customer retention rate of more than 50% quarter over quarter.\n\u201cTerragon is poised to ride a wave that will intersect software, traditional telcos, enterprise and digital native businesses. The size of the opportunity was very convincing to us, their existing ambition and investment in Africa-focused software products was compelling, as well as the vision of how African mobile users will evolve in coming years, fit right into the strategy of Orange Ventures,\u201d Gr\u00e9goire de Padirac, partner at Orange Ventures, said of the investment.\n\u201cThey are Africa\u2019s pioneer specializing in cloud-native data software, which serves as the fundamental building blocks for enterprise AI across the continent. With protected intellectual property, an inventive business model, and a strong presence in multiple markets, they are well-positioned to establish a strong leadership across the continent.\u201d\nUh oh! European carriers are trying to get into \u2018personalized\u2019 ad targeting"

            "content": "Bloom Money, a U.K.-based fintech, has raised \u00a31 million to digitize an informal financial management system employed by ethnic communities across the world.\nOften referred to as \u201crotating savings and credit association\u201d (ROSCA), the model varies in the details around the world, but usually, it involves an informal gathering of people from a certain community who act as a bank, collecting and saving money that members can withdraw. The system is called different names across the world, such as \u201chagbad\u201d in Somalia or \u201cpardna\u201d in parts of the Caribbean.\nThe goal is to avoid conventional banking systems, many of which discriminate against minority communities, especially in the U.K., CEO Nina Mohanty said. \u201cSome of it is just blatant racism. We don\u2019t have clear red-lining like in the U.S., but there are definitely postcode look-ups,\u201d she said.\nThe ROSCA system is a way to conduct financial matters with people you trust, she said, \u201cwhether that is by race, nationality, we\u2019ve even got people down to the tribe level.\u201d Bloom Money wants to digitize this ROSCA process.\nA daughter of two immigrants to the U.S., Mohanty says she decided to work on this problem after she moved to the U.K. and learned for herself just how difficult it can be for an immigrant to set themselves up financially. \u201cI just felt that there was not just an economic justice point to this, but also a huge opportunity, where people only think of the U.S. as a country of immigrants, but increasingly across Europe, we know migration is growing,\u201d she said.\nHer co-founder and CTO Dan James believes in the system because he\u2019s seen how effective it can be, growing up in an ethnic community in central Birmingham. \u201cI saw firsthand the benefits that using ROSCAs can bring people, especially those entering the U.K. who have historically been underserved by the existing financial sector,\u201d he said.\nThe company will use the funds from the pre-seed round to continue building its digital savings features, which has all funds safeguarded by an electronic money institution. The fundraising was led by Zinal Growth, and saw January Ventures, Pact VC and angel investors B\u00e9r\u00e9nice Magistretti and June Angelides M.B.E. participating.\nBloom Money lets people create groups, known as \u201cBloom circles,\u201d to share and save money with. It also has educational materials on the basics of life in the U.K., such as how to get a driver\u2019s license, setting up a trust fund and an explainer on credit scores.\nImage Credits: Bloom Money\nImage Credits: Bloom Money\nMohanty described the fundraising process as \u201creally interesting.\u201d She said the most challenging part was explaining to investors that the company intended to target very underserved communities. At first, there was a lot of misunderstanding, she said. \u201cSome very racist, xenophobic things were said to us,\u201d she said. \u201cEven going through the regulation process, there was a lot of prejudice that we had to overcome.\u201d\nMohanty and James say they wanted ethnic and gender diversity on their cap table, and they seem to have managed that so far: Nearly 70% of their cap table identifies as women, almost 50% comes from a minority ethnic background and about half identify as first or second-generation immigrants.\nAngelides, an angel investor, said Bloom Money was her first angel fintech investment, and she knew right off the bat how big of a problem the company is trying to solve since she grew up in Nigeria, where cash is king. \u201cCommunities have struggled for generations with trust in financial systems and have preferred to use community-based saving methods, such as Ajo (the Nigerian version of the ROSCA system).\u201d\n\u201cThis comes with its own set of problems, from people absconding with funds to people being unable to significantly grow wealth. This is where Bloom Money comes in,\u201d Angelidas added. \u201cA lot of migrant communities remit large amounts to their home countries each year. With Bloom, they now also have an opportunity to build stronger ties with the U.K., grow their wealth and qualify for additional products that they ordinarily would have struggled to access.\u201d"

            "content": "FarmWorks, a Kenyan agtech that provides farmers with access to farm inputs, and market for their produce, has raised $4.1 million in a pre-Series A round led by Acumen Resilient Agriculture Fund, an existing investor. Livelihood Impact Fund, Vested World, a number of family offices and angel investors also participated in the round that brought the total equity funding raised by FarmWorks to $5.6 million.\nFarmWorks CEO Yi Li, who co-founded the startup with Peter Muthee in 2020, told TechCrunch that they will use the funding to strengthen their data analytics capabilities, and use AI to enhance production and influence planting and lending decisions.\nFarmWorks runs an out-grower scheme that brings together more than 2,000 smallholder farmers, which has helped it to build a supply chain network that ensures timely delivery of quality produce. It plans to grow its network of contract farmers in other regions within Kenya, in addition to the two counties in the central region of the country, where it is currently operational and has 16 collection centers.\nThe startup provides farmers with farm inputs, and pest control services, and buys their produce for export, or local sales. It also provides them with farming equipment like drip irrigation kits, on loan.\n\u201cWe are transforming what they are farming, and their income by introducing higher value crops like sugar snaps and snow peas, and finding the market. So, we become vertically integrated from day-one in both the production and the distribution side of the business,\u201d said Li.\nAfrican climate startups set to gain ground as VC funding shifts their way\nThe startup is tapping gaps in Kenya\u2019s agriculture sector, which accounts for 20% of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), and employs 70% of people in the rural areas, according to this report. However, while agriculture remains a critical sector for the Kenyan economy, small scale farmers, who are the majority, are faced with myriad challenges, including lack of quality farm inputs, information on good agricultural practices, inadequate advisory support and unpredictable or unreliable markets.\nThe startup also teaches the farmers on good agricultural practices, which it demonstrates on its own trial farms.\n\u201cWe have a strong belief that the huge issue facing farmers in Kenya is production \u2014 the low yield is mainly due to poor farming practices, and soil degradation that has happened over the years,\u201d said Li, who added that the startup is unlocking production and by boosting farmers\u2019 capacity. The startup sells about 400 tons of farm produce a month.\nFarmWorks previously engaged in crop production on its own farms, which it has now turned into training centers.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of operational expenditure in running a big farm, and we realized that for the same efforts, we can cover a lot more farmers. That is why this year, we made a strategic decision to scale our out-grower scheme because that seemed to pick up much faster. We will be using our farms as training centers,\u201d said Li. Li previously worked in Kenya as a management consultant for McKinsey, prior to launching FarmWorks with Muthee, who has been in the agriculture space for nearly three decades.\nTwiga starts commercial farming, looking to guarantee quality, sustain supply"

            "content": "Business is regularly won and lost on the strength of a proposal. Now, a startup out of London called AutogenAI has built a tool based on generative AI that it claims can help businesses write stronger pitches to improve that strike rate, and it has won some money of its own: $22.3 million from Blossom Capital, which it is using to hire more talent, expand its platform and grow its customer base.\nThe investment values AutogenAI in the region of \u201chundreds of millions,\u201d we understand from a source. It previously raised some $3.5 million.\nAs a measure of AutogenAI\u2019s success, it\u2019s managed to pick up 28 clients since it first opened for business less than a year ago.\nAnd as a measure of just how guarded those customers are about the secret sauce they\u2019re using to win their deals, and maybe the taboo that exists around using AI tools to replace or augment human work, AutogenAI is not disclosing a single actual customer name.\n\u201cThere is still a feeling among customers that using AI would somehow detract from the quality of the work,\u201d Sean Williams, the founder and CEO, said in an interview, explaining why no names are being disclosed.\n(AutogenAI does note \u2014 in a press release that it proudly says was written by AutogenAI, it is a pitch after all \u2014 that the list includes \u201ca global management consultancy, global BPO organisations, quoted and private construction companies and facilities management businesses, as well as charities and non-profits applying for grant funding.\u201d)\nWilliams cut his teeth on years of working for some of the biggest private firms bidding to provide services to the U.K. government, an enormous business that collectively is worth nearly $500 billion annually.\nBeing successful in those tenders was a matter of experience, understanding what content to include and how to present it. But it was also a matter of budget: Those with the funds to invest in building strong bids regularly had a stronger chance of winning deals.\nAutogenAI\u2019s aim is to address both of these areas.\nWilliams said that the platform is built on an amalgamation of large language models \u2014 it uses LLMs from OpenAI and others, he said \u2014 combined with a client\u2019s structured and unstructured proprietary data, and an interface developed by AutogenAI itself to help users query information and create pitches that in turn are based on a company\u2019s most successful past work. These are then presented to the client\u2019s team, which further tailors them \u2014 or potentially rejects them \u2014 before they are submitted to pitch for a contract.\nIn theory, one could ask ChatGPT to build a business pitch, but Williams response is that AutogenAI\u2019s versions will be considerably more specific and thus ultimately more useful to its users.\n\u201cCompanies like OpenAI are focused on AGI, super intelligence,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a much smaller problem: We just want to help our customers win more work and work more effectively.\u201d He estimated that AutogenAI\u2019s software could speed up the process of writing a strong pitch \u201cby 800%.\u201d\nThat 800% speaks to the second area of winning bids, which is the required budget outlay. Williams estimates that some 10% of a total contract value can be eaten up by the cost of putting a bid together in the traditional way. His claim is that by using its tools it cuts down procurement costs by some 10%, improving the margins on those deals overall, with the time taken to write the first drafts of bids cut down by 70% and helping those working on bids to focus more on strategic additions.\nOphelia Brown, the founder of Blossom Capital, said that the firm was not yet using AutogenAI itself but that it planned to when it next raised funds. Its interest in the startup stemmed from the fact that while AI companies building LLMs are getting a lot of attention right now, those working on applications like AutogenAI are closer to where a wider range of businesses might make purchasing decisions.\n\u201cWhere this gets\u00a0interesting is when you can see clear ROI on the spend for the product,\u201d she said. \u201cCompanies are willing to pay for something that can help them save time and headcount.\u201d That\u2019s been proven out, she added, through its growth in its first nine months of business."
